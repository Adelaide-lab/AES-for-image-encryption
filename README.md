# AES for image encryption
This is a project based on C, and I use AES algorithm to encrypt the image.
Note that this project is very simple, and can only encrypt bmp file, cause its storage is very simple.
The first 54 bytes saves the basic information for bmp files, but jpg or other storage mode is very complex,they have both prefix and suffix, so to encrpt these kinds of files can be a little harder,if you have any good idea for that, please send it to my e-mail.
